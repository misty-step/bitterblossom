# Bitterblossom Composition v1 — "Fae Court"
#
# Hypothesis: 5 full-stack sprites with specialization preferences produce
# higher quality output than generalist sprites, while maintaining flexibility.
#
# All can handle any task. Preferences guide Kaylee's routing decisions.
# This composition is an experiment — compare against future compositions.

      - Monitoring and observability

  moss:

    strengths:
      - Code refactoring, simplification
      - Technical debt reduction
      - Architecture decisions, documentation
      - Module boundary design

experiment:
  hypothesis: "Specialized sprites produce higher quality domain work than generalists"
  metrics:
    - Task completion rate
    - Code review feedback quality
    - Time to completion
    - Routing accuracy (was the right sprite chosen?)
  comparison: null  # No previous composition to compare against yet
  notes: |
    Track observations in observations/OBSERVATIONS.md.
    After 20+ observations, evaluate whether specialization matters.
    Consider v2: fewer sprites (3?), different specializations, or generalists.
