# Observation Journal

Kaylee's notes on what's working and what isn't. **Update after every meaningful task dispatch.**

This is the core feedback loop. Without observations, compositions are just guesses.

## How to Log

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <Sprite> — <Task Type>
**Task:** Brief description
**Repo:** org/repo (if applicable)
**Outcome:** Success / Partial / Failed
**Time:** Approximate duration
**Routing decision:** Why this sprite? Was it the right call?
**Quality notes:** What went well, what didn't
**Action:** Keep / Adjust routing / Change base config / Investigate
```

## What to Watch For

- **Routing accuracy:** Did the sprite's specialization help, or would any sprite have done equally well?
- **Cross-domain tasks:** Tasks that touch multiple specializations — who handles them best?
- **Config drift:** Are sprites modifying their own CLAUDE.md in useful ways? Harvest those changes for base.
- **Failure patterns:** Same type of mistake across sprites = base config issue. Sprite-specific mistake = persona issue.
- **Time patterns:** Some task types consistently faster on certain sprites? That's signal.
