The `/naming-conventions` directory serves as a standardized rule engine within a broader skills framework, designed to enforce language-agnostic naming integrity and domain-driven design principles. Its architecture is centered on a single definition file, `SKILL.md`, which encapsulates both the technical configuration for automated analysis and the heuristic logic for identifier evaluation.

The primary role of `SKILL.md` is to provide a machine-readable specification that dictates how code should be analyzed for clarity and intent. The file contains YAML metadata that restricts the skill's operational scope to `Read` and `Grep` tools, indicating its function is primarily investigative and evaluative. The core content establishes a strict taxonomy of naming patterns, mandating the use of "Positive Patterns" (such as verb-noun functions and boolean question prefixes) while explicitly prohibiting generic implementation-leaking suffixes like `Manager`, `Helper`, or `Util`.

Key architectural aspects and dependencies include:
*   **Operational Constraints**: The skill is configured as `user-invocable: false`, signifying it is intended for internal system orchestration or automated linting processes rather than direct manual execution.
*   **Tool Dependencies**: The skill relies on the availability of `Read` and `Grep` tools to scan source code and verify compliance with the documented patterns.
*   **Pattern Logic**: The architecture prioritizes "Function Verbs" based on side-effect status (e.g., `format` for pure transformations vs. `save` for state changes) and enforces pluralization for collections while banning implementation-specific suffixes like `Array` or `List`.
*   **Gotchas**: While the skill enforces a strict prohibition on generic suffixes, it includes context-aware exceptions for specific architectural patterns such as `Factories`, `Repositories`, and framework-mandated `EventBuses`. Users must account for these exceptions when applying the skill to codebases that rely heavily on these specific design patterns.
