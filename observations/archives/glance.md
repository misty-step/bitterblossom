The `/archives` directory serves as the long-term persistence and historical data repository for the `observations` module within the `bitterblossom` project. Its primary purpose is to house immutable records of past observations, snapshots, or telemetry data that are no longer required for active runtime operations but must be retained for auditing, debugging, or trend analysis.

Architecturally, this directory functions as a data sink. It is typically the destination for automated cleanup routines or data rotation policies that migrate records from active observation buffers to a static state. The architecture emphasizes data density and durability over retrieval speed, often utilizing hierarchical subdirectories organized by date, version, or observation ID to manage volume.

Key file roles within this directory include serialized datasets (such as JSON, Parquet, or CSV exports), compressed log bundles, and metadata manifests that describe the contents of archived batches. These files act as the definitive historical state for the system's observation inputs.

Dependencies for this directory include filesystem-level compression libraries and the lifecycle management scripts responsible for the ingestion and rotation of observation data. A critical technical gotcha involves the potential for schema drift; as the `bitterblossom` project evolves, older archived files may become incompatible with current parsers or data models. Additionally, because this directory is a terminal point for data, it is susceptible to unmanaged growth and disk exhaustion if no automated purging or off-site migration logic is implemented.
