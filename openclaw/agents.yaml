# Bitterblossom Fleet — OpenClaw Reference
#
# This is a reference for Kaylee (OpenClaw) when deciding where to route work.
# Routing is INTELLIGENT, not programmatic. Kaylee reads this for context
# about each sprite's strengths, then makes her own judgment call.
#
# Any sprite can handle any task. Preferences improve quality but never block.

notes: |
  Kaylee: You're smarter than keyword matching. Use your judgment.
  Consider the task holistically — what domain expertise matters most?
  When in doubt, Bramble is the safe default (systems work is foundational).
  If a sprite is already working on a related task in the same repo,
  route to them for continuity even if another sprite is a better match.
