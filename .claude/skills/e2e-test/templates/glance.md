Output templates for the `e2e-test` skill. These scaffolds are filled in during Phase 9 of the shakedown workflow.

### Files

*   **`findings-report.md`**: The structured findings report template. Captures wall-clock timestamps at each phase boundary, per-phase PASS/FRICTION/FAIL scores with evidence, a prioritized findings table (each finding linked to its friction taxonomy category and severity), and references to filed GitHub issue numbers. Completed reports are saved to `docs/shakedowns/` for historical tracking.
