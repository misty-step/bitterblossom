# CLAUDE.md — DEPRECATED

> ⚠️ **Claude Code is deprecated for Bitterblossom sprite dispatch.**
> 
> All agent context is now in `AGENTS.md`.
> All architecture decisions are in `docs/SPRITE-ARCHITECTURE.md`.
> 
> OpenCode is the sole agent harness. See `OPENCODE.md` for configuration.
> 
> This file is retained only for backward compatibility with Claude Code
> sessions that may still reference it.

See `AGENTS.md` for the canonical project context.
